        <!--Site Introduction-->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

Providing you with a deeper look into my life, and my soul.</p>

        <!--About Section-->
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey, I’m Scotty—developer, founder, and full-time builder based out of St. John’s, Newfoundland. I’m currently studying Software Development at the College of the North Atlantic, where I’m sharpening my skills in Python, Flask, SQL, and web development. But code is only one piece of what I do.
            I’m also the founder and president of the St. John’s Hike Club, a free, inclusive hiking community that’s grown into a real movement. What started as a small idea to get people outside has turned into a full-fledged organization with scheduled hikes, local sponsorships, partnerships with businesses like The Outfitters and the East Coast Trail Association, and a growing team of volunteers. We host themed hikes, bonfires, giveaways, and mental health initiatives—all built around connection, movement, and community.            
            On the tech side, I’m developing NEVER86, a restaurant management platform built for people who actually work in restaurants. After spending years as a host, server, line cook, barista, and busser, I saw firsthand how chaotic and outdated restaurant systems can be. So I’m building a solution from the ground up—one that includes inventory tracking, order placement, manager scheduling, and real-time insights, all while staying lean and intuitive. NEVER86 isn’t just a POS—it’s a full-stack platform made to make life easier for the people who keep hospitality alive.            
            Beyond the projects, I’m someone who thrives in chaos, learns fast, and isn’t afraid to take big swings. I’ve always been a hands-on learner, which means I sometimes build things before I fully understand them—but that’s also how I’ve grown so quickly. I use tools like ChatGPT (hi) to extend what I can do on my own, and I’m obsessed with the idea of self-improvement through action. Whether it’s coding a new feature, planning a group hike, or pitching a startup idea, I like being in motion.
            If you know me, you know I’m curious, maybe a little chaotic, and always chasing something meaningful. My work is a mix of tech, design, community, and personal growth. It’s messy, ambitious, and constantly evolving—just like me.
            This site is my home base. A place to show what I’m building, document the journey, and hopefully connect with other people who are doing cool shit too. If you want to collaborate, talk shop, or just say hi, I’m always down.</p>
