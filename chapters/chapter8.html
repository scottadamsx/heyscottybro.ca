        <h1>Chapter 8: Laugh Track</h1>

        <section>
            <p>If you can’t be safe, be funny.</p>
            <p>That was the rule I made for myself in junior high.</p>
            <p>It started slow. One-liners. Sarcastic little jabs at teachers that made the kids laugh but didn’t quite cross the line. Then impressions. Stupid voices. Playing dumb to get someone else to laugh hard enough to forget I didn’t quite belong.</p>
            <p>The laughter became currency. A way to buy a few minutes of safety. Because if they were laughing, they weren’t asking questions. And they weren’t picking. And they weren’t noticing the polos, or the silence, or the way I flinched when someone raised their voice too fast.</p>
            <p>Aiden called me the funniest person he knew. That meant more to me than he realized. Because I wasn’t born funny. I was shaped into it. Moulded. Crafted. Refined by years of measuring every room before I entered it. Learning what tone to use with who. How to disarm, distract, dissolve.</p>
            <p>Humour was a shield. And sometimes, it worked too well. I started cracking jokes in class just to avoid being asked anything real. If a teacher looked at me too long, I’d throw out a self-deprecating one-liner to keep it light. Keep it easy. Because the alternative was being seen. And being seen meant being known. And being known meant being vulnerable. And I couldn’t afford that. Not at school.</p>
            <p>Not at home. At home, I wasn’t the funny one. I was the issue. The problem. The boy with the bad attitude. When I made jokes at home, they didn’t land. Dad didn’t laugh. Mom would sigh. My sisters would roll their eyes.</p>
            <p>Except Sophie.</p>
            <p>She smiled sometimes. But it wasn’t enough to keep me trying. So I saved my best lines for school. For the halls. For the bus rides. That’s where I learned that being the funny one meant people needed you. And when people needed you, they kept you close. Even if they didn’t know you. Especially if they didn’t know you. It was easy to play a role when the audience was clapping. The harder part was when the lights came off. When I got home, took off the shirt, and sat in my room, staring at the wall, wondering if the real me even existed anymore.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, when the silence got too loud, I’d grab the lamb.</p>
            <p>By then it was missing one eye. The thread around the ear had frayed. The stuffing had collapsed in places. It looked tired. Like it had seen too much. I’d hold it in my lap. Not tight. Just enough to feel it was there. Like a prop from an old play I wasn’t allowed to forget. It used to comfort me. Now it reminded me of who I had to bury to survive.</p>
