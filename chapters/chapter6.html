        <h1>Chapter 6: Sweat</h1>

        <section>
            <p>Hockey was supposed to be the one thing we had in common.</p>
            <p>He loved it. Said it built character. Said it made boys into men. Said you could tell everything you needed to know about someone by how they skated into a corner.</p>
            <p>At first, I tried to love it too. I wasn’t bad. I could skate. I could shoot. But I didn’t have that hunger, that edge he wanted me to have. I wasn’t aggressive enough. Not fast enough. Not ruthless. I liked the game. He loved the war in it.</p>
            <p>After every match, I’d brace myself in the car for the postmortem.</p>
            <p>“Why didn’t you fight for the puck?”</p>
            <p>“You were just floating out there.”</p>
            <p>“Did you even try?”</p>
            <p>I’d stare out the window, helmet in my lap, fingers still numb from the cold. He’d sigh like I’d failed a written test.</p>
            <p>One game, we lost bad. I wasn’t the reason, but I wasn’t the hero either. We got in the car. He said nothing. That was worse. We drove in silence all the way home. In the driveway, I unbuckled my seatbelt.</p>
            <p>“Did you sweat?”</p>
            <p>I looked at him. “What?”</p>
            <p>“Take off your helmet.”</p>
            <p>I didn’t move.</p>
            <p>“Take it off.” I pulled the helmet off slowly, fingers fumbling with the strap. He leaned across the console and ran his fingers through my hair. Checking. For sweat.</p>
            <p>His jaw tightened. “You didn’t try hard enough.”</p>
            <p>That became the new metric. Not goals. Not heart. Not teamwork. Sweat.</p>
            <p>If I wasn’t sweating, I wasn’t trying. If I wasn’t trying, I wasn’t worth taking to the rink. It didn’t matter how I played—only how much I suffered. That’s how he measured effort. By discomfort. Pain was proof. Anything less was laziness.</p>
            <p>One game, I played hard. Genuinely hard. Fought for the puck. Took a hit into the boards. Scored once. Still, after the game: “Didn’t see you break a sweat.”</p>
            <p>It didn’t matter what I’d done. Only what he didn’t see.</p>
            <p>At home, I started pretending. Before he came in the door, I’d rub my hands together, splash water on my neck in the locker room, mess up my hair—just in case. So he’d see something. So he’d believe it. So I wouldn’t have to explain that just existing around him made me sweat more than any game ever could.</p>
            <p>Mom didn’t come to most games. Said she didn’t like the cold. I think she just didn’t like seeing the after. The evaluations. The quiet disappointment that hung in the car like a second set of shoulder pads.</p>
            <p>I used to love the sound of skates on fresh ice. Now it made my stomach tighten.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I stopped asking if he saw my plays. Stopped caring if he clapped when I made a pass. Because the only applause I ever got was conditional. If I pushed someone into the boards. If I argued with a ref. If I made someone else feel small.</p>
            <p>That was when I earned his nod. That was when he was proud. Not when I played the game. But when I played his game.</p>
            <p>And I learned. I learned how to show sweat, even when I didn’t have it. I learned that some fathers don’t want sons. They want warriors. I learned that hockey wasn't about skating. It was about survival.</p>
