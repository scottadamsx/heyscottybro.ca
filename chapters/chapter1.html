        <h1>Chapter 1: The Sound the Floor Made</h1>

        <section>
            <p>Before the yelling.</p>
            <p>Before the slammed doors.</p>
            <p>Before the words that carved valleys into my skin without ever touching me—there was the sound the floor made when he came home.</p>
            <p>That’s how I knew.</p>
            <p>We lived in a modest house just off a quiet cul-de-sac, the kind of place with salt-stained driveways and neighbours who never asked questions. It was never loud, never chaotic. You’d think something terrible would announce itself. But our house whispered.</p>
            <p>Dad’s boots always hit the floor with intention. First the key in the lock. Then the click of the door. Then the step—one, two—onto the tile just past the welcome mat. I could hear the stiffness in his knees when he walked, the shift in weight like he was measuring how much space he was allowed to take up.</p>
            <p>Or maybe how much space he wanted the rest of us to give him.</p>
            <p>By the time I was ten, I didn’t need to see him to know what kind of night it would be. I could tell from the way the fridge door opened. From how long the water ran in the sink. From the sigh he let out right before he said, “I’m home.”</p>
            <p>It didn’t sound like a greeting.</p>
            <p>It sounded like a warning.</p>
            <p>He wasn’t always there.</p>
            <p>When I was younger, he worked out at sea. Long stints. Weeks at a time. When he came home, he smelled like oil and salt and wind. I used to be excited to see him. He’d bring little trinkets from other towns—a mug from Halifax, a hockey puck from Quebec. Once, he gave me a lamb stuffed animal from a ferry gift shop in Nova Scotia. I named it nothing. It didn’t need a name.</p>
            <p>I just held it. Especially when he was gone. Back then, he didn’t yell much. Because he wasn’t around enough to build momentum. Then he got promoted. Shore job. No more trips. No more distance. Just us—together, always. The lamb stayed on my bed. So did he.</p>
            <p>I didn’t know what discipline was supposed to look like. I only knew how it felt: tight, cold, precise. Like a rope pulled too hard across your chest. Dad didn’t scream, not at first. He was more interested in silence. Rules. Posture.</p>
            <p>He believed in strength. Professionalism. Pride. He didn’t trust softness. Not in me. Not in himself. Mom said he just wanted me to be strong. That he didn’t want me to grow up like “other boys.” That I’d understand one day. But all I understood at ten was that being near him made my throat tight and my body quiet.</p>
            <p>There was a night I remember clearer than most. He’d just come home. Boots on tile. The sigh. The fridge door opened, then slammed shut harder than usual.</p>
            <p>I was upstairs. Not in trouble, not yet. I sat on the edge of my bed, the lamb beside me, threadbare from being held too often. I ran my fingers over the curve of its stitched-on smile, a smile that didn’t know how to flinch.</p>
            <p>Then I heard my name.</p>
            <p>Sharp. Clean. Like it had been practiced. I pressed my hand against the lamb’s belly. No heartbeat. No answers. I stood, slowly. The floorboards knew me better than he did. They creaked in surrender. If you ask me when the fear started, I couldn’t tell you.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t a moment. It was a slow accumulation. A gathering of tension in the spine, behind the eyes, under the tongue. It was realizing that your voice was too expensive to use. That silence was safer than asking why. That even stuffed animals could be witnesses. The lamb watched everything. From its corner of the bed. From under my arm. From the floor where it fell after I tossed it one night, angry that it couldn’t do anything but listen.</p>
            <p>He wasn’t a monster, not always. He made breakfast sometimes. Took me to hockey. Bought me books. But even the gifts came with strings. A book could become a test. A hockey game could become a courtroom. A house could become a prison. And love? Love was never free.</p>
            <p>The lamb stayed with me. Quiet. Soft. Loyal.</p>
            <p>Until I wasn’t. Until I outgrew softness. Until I learned that lambs don’t survive in houses ruled by lions.</p>
