            <p>It didn’t start with fists.</p>
            <p>It started with something small. Something stupid. I don’t remember what. Maybe I forgot to do a chore. Maybe I left the milk out. Maybe I said “why” one too many times. What I do remember is how it felt. How fast it happened. How it went from tension to terror like a light switch snapping on.</p>
            <p>We were in the kitchen. He said something I thought was unfair. I questioned it. He got upset. I pushed back. He didn’t like that. Voices rose. Mine was trembling, his wasn’t. Not yet. But it got there. Yelling. Spit on my face.</p>
            <p>And then—he hit me.</p>
            <p>A sharp crack across the side of my head. Not with a closed fist. Just enough to remind me who was in charge. Just enough to tip the balance. I stumbled. Not because it hurt—though it did—but because it felt like falling through the floor of the world.</p>
            <p>I couldn’t breathe.</p>
            <p>My heart exploded in my chest and then disappeared completely. My lungs forgot how to fill. My hands went cold.</p>
            <p>A panic attack. That was my first one. I slid to the floor, knees to my chest, clutching my ribs like they might split open.</p>
            <p>He stood over me like a monster in a dream. Breathing hard. Red-faced. Ashamed, maybe. But not of what he did. Of me. Of making him do it.</p>
            <p>“You made me do that,” he said. “You pushed me there.”</p>
            <p>Then he left.</p>
            <p>The floor was cold. I remember the tile pressing into my shoulder. I don’t know how long I stayed there. At some point, I crawled upstairs.</p>
            <p>The lamb was on my bed. I didn’t want to hold it. But I did. Not because it helped. But because it remembered who I used to be.</p>
