            <p>The fuse was always lit. We just got better at pretending we couldn’t smell the smoke.</p>
            <p>Coming home hadn’t changed anything. If anything, it made things worse. I was bigger now. Stronger. Louder. Sharper around the edges. So was he. But only on the inside. The difference was—I wasn’t afraid to show mine anymore.</p>
            <p>We’d been dancing around each other for weeks. Tight hallways. Muted greetings. Passive-aggressive silences passed like heirlooms. Then one night, it broke.</p>
            <p>It was small.</p>
            <p>It always is.</p>
            <p>A comment. A tone. A misunderstanding thick with years of unresolved shit behind it. We were in the kitchen. I said something about dinner. He snapped. “You don’t like it, don’t eat it.” I pushed back. “It’s not about the food.” “Then what’s it about, tough guy?”</p>
            <p>There it was. That tone. The one that said <em>you’re still a boy to me</em>.</p>
            <p>Sophie was in the kitchen. So was Mom. Abbey was out. I don’t even remember the rest of what we said. It spiraled. Fast. Sophie said my name once. I ignored her. Then I said I was leaving. Taking the car.</p>
            <p>He stepped in front of me. Blocked the door. “You don’t take what you don’t earn.” He snatched the keys out of my hand.</p>
            <p>And that’s when it happened. Not a punch. Not a slap. But we were shoving. Grabbing. Furniture shifted. Chairs scraped tile. My body moved on instinct. His did too. Two lions in a room too small for one.</p>
            <p>Sophie screamed. Mom jumped in between us, yelling. “Sophie—call the police!”</p>
            <p>Sophie froze. Her back hit the counter. She sank to the floor, breathing like she was underwater. Panic attack. Mom was pushing me. Pushing him. Screaming both our names.</p>
            <p>And then—</p>
            <p>Silence.</p>
            <p>I stepped back. Looked down. He was on the floor. I was standing over him. Mom had her hand on my chest, holding me back even though I wasn’t moving anymore. Sophie was sobbing into her hands. The kitchen smelled like sweat, fear, and burned pride.</p>
            <p>I wasn’t afraid of him anymore. That terrified me most.</p>
