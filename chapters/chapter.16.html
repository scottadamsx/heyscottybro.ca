        <section>
            <p>My daughter flinched when I raised my voice.</p>
            <p>Just once.</p>
            <p>A small moment. Barely there. A thunderclap in my chest.</p>
            <p>She was three.</p>
            <p>Spilled orange juice on the floor. I was tired. Work had been relentless. Emails, deadlines, three client calls, and a Slack war with my dev team. I turned around too fast. Raised my voice without raising my heart.</p>
            <p>“Come on, we’ve talked about this!”</p>
            <p>That was all I said. And she flinched. Shoulders up. Hands near her face. Like she was ready for something worse.</p>
            <p>I froze. The mug in my hand felt hot and stupid. She looked up at me. No tears. Just waiting.</p>
            <p>I dropped to one knee. Said her name. Soft. Real. “Daddy’s sorry. That wasn’t okay.” She nodded. But she didn’t come closer. She just went to her mom and whispered something I didn’t hear.</p>
            <p>Later that night, I couldn’t sleep. I sat in the living room and stared at my hands. These hands that had learned to code. To hold a steering wheel. To carry groceries. To throw a punch.</p>
            <p>To build a life.</p>
            <p>And maybe… To pass something down.</p>
            <p>I used to say I’m nothing like him.</p>
            <p>Now I wasn’t so sure.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I get quiet around my kids. Not because I don’t love them. Because I’m afraid of what they might absorb from me.</p>
            <p>My tone.</p>
            <p>My pace.</p>
            <p>My tension. The way my body tenses when a question feels like pressure. The way I “correct” too quickly. The way I demand silence just because the noise inside me is louder than the one outside.</p>
            <p>At bedtime, my son asked me if monsters were real. I said no. Then paused. Then said: “Some monsters used to be good people. They just got stuck in their own hurt.” He looked confused. I kissed his forehead and turned off the light.</p>
            <p>My wife asked if I was okay. I told her I was just thinking. She nodded. She knew what that meant by now.</p>
            <p>The next day, I took the kids to the trail. Not for the club. Just us. I watched them walk ahead, laughing. Free. I walked slower. Behind them. Like a shadow that chose not to overtake the sun.</p>
            <p><strong>Legacy</strong> is a heavy word. People think it means wealth. Success. A name. But really? Legacy is tone of voice. It’s patience. Or lack of it. It’s the way you respond to spilled juice.</p>
            <p>The lawyer emailed me that night. The case was moving forward. My father would be served in a matter of days. I stared at the screen for a long time. Then closed the laptop. And went upstairs. To tuck in my daughter. To be soft. To be safe. To start over.</p>
