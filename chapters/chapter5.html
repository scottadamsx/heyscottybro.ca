        <h1>Chapter 5: Polo Shirts</h1>

        <section>
            <p>It started in junior high, when the boys around me stopped wearing uniforms and started wearing themselves.</p>
            <p>Graphic T-shirts with band logos. Basketball jerseys. Weird designs with wolves and dragons and pop culture references I didn’t understand. One kid wore the same “Thrasher” hoodie every day until it smelled like a haunted skatepark.</p>
            <p>I wanted in. Not to stand out. Just to blend. But in our house, T-shirts were “sloppy.” Unprofessional. Lazy. Dad said it like a curse.</p>
            <p>“You’re not walking around like you’ve given up on life. Button up. Be proud.”</p>
            <p>He made me wear polo shirts. Every morning. Stiff collars, heavy cotton, tucked in tight like I was going to a job interview for a position I didn’t apply for.</p>
            <p>I hated them. I hated what they said about me before I ever opened my mouth. And it didn’t help that I was already different. Brown in a white school. Quiet when the other boys were loud. Too polite. Too observant. Too in-between.</p>
            <p>The polos made it worse.</p>
            <p>One day a kid muttered in homeroom, “Does he dress like that on purpose?” Another whispered, “He looks like he’s waiting for immigration paperwork.”</p>
            <p>I laughed. Not because it was funny. Because I was already used to pretending things didn’t hurt. And it wasn’t like I could say anything at home. I tried once.</p>
            <p>“I just want to wear a T-shirt. Like the other kids.”</p>
            <p>“You want to look like a bum? You think that’s how people succeed?”</p>
            <p>“It’s just a shirt.”</p>
            <p>“No. It’s a signal.”</p>
            <p>There was pride in the way he said it. But it sounded like a sentence.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I stopped asking. Instead, I started sneaking shirts into my backpack. Folded tight. Hidden under my binders and gym clothes. I’d wait until I got to school, duck into the bathroom, and change before class.</p>
            <p>For a while, it worked. Until it didn’t.</p>
            <p>One morning, Dad walked into my room without knocking. He pulled open my bag and found a crumpled T-shirt wedged in the bottom. Said nothing.</p>
            <p>The next day, he started checking my bag before school. Not always. Just enough to keep me guessing.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he said things like:</p>
            <p>“Anything in here I should know about?”</p>
            <p>“Let’s make sure you’re not lying to your own father.”</p>
            <p>“Be honest. It’s the only way people will respect you.”</p>
            <p>I told Aiden and Chad about it at lunch. Laughed like it was a joke. “My old man’s got a collar fetish. Wants me to look like a bank teller.”</p>
            <p>Chad squinted. “Bro. You’ve gotta be boiling in those.”</p>
            <p>The next Monday, they showed up with shirts of their own.</p>
            <p>Tossed them to me like a deal going down in a locker room. Aiden’s had a cracked Mario graphic on the front. Chad’s was just a black tee with a bleach stain that looked like a wolf.</p>
            <p>“One for each day you grow a spine,” Chad said, grinning.</p>
            <p>I didn’t say thank you.</p>
            <p>I just smiled and slipped them into my locker, hidden behind my spare gym shoes and a half-empty deodorant stick. For a few weeks, I wore their shirts at school and changed back before I got home. But it didn’t last.</p>
            <p>Dad caught me again. Didn’t yell. Just stared. Disappointed. Like I’d broken a covenant.</p>
            <p>The next morning, there were no inspections. They just stopped.</p>
            <p>I thought maybe he’d finally eased up.</p>
            <p>But really, he’d just started noticing my sisters.</p>
            <p>They were older now. Softer. More expressive. They cried more. And he didn’t like that. The attention shifted. And suddenly, I could breathe again. At least a little.</p>
            <p>First day of high school, I wore a plain black tee. No logos. No slogans. No buttons.</p>
            <p>Nobody said anything. But all day, I kept waiting to hear the sound of boots on tile.</p>
