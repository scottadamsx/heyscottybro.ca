            <p>The house was still. That kind of still where even the floorboards feel like they’re holding their breath.</p>
            <p>He stayed on the floor longer than he needed to. I didn’t help him up. Mom was still between us. Her hand pressed to my chest, not forceful—just… there. A signal. A gate. A reminder that I could stop now.</p>
            <p>I didn’t say anything. Neither did he. He stood eventually. Said nothing. Walked to the other room like it hadn’t happened. Like we’d both agreed not to tell on each other.</p>
            <p>Sophie sat in the kitchen corner, her knees to her chest. Breathing shallow. Mom tried to talk to her. Soothe her. She flinched every time a voice got too loud. Even Abbey was quiet that night. When she came home, she didn’t joke. She lit a joint in the bathroom and said nothing.</p>
            <p>I sat in the guest room. The bed creaked under me. The lamb was still there on the shelf. Still missing its eye. Still smiling. It made me feel sick.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t comfort anymore. It was an accusation. A soft thing that had watched me become someone else. Someone my dad had made. Someone my mother couldn’t stop. Someone my sister feared.</p>
            <p>I picked it up. Held it in both hands. It used to help me sleep. Used to remind me of my grandmother’s house. Safety. Warmth. A version of myself that hadn't learned to raise his voice.</p>
            <p>Now? It felt wrong. Too light. Too soft. Too false. “You were supposed to protect me.” No answer. Of course not.</p>
            <p>I ripped the lamb’s neck seam wider with my thumbs. Not all the way. Just enough to feel it give. Then I walked downstairs. Opened the trash. Dropped it in. Didn’t look back.</p>
            <p>I went outside. Stood in the cold. Let the air bite. Mom came to the door, wrapped in her cardigan.</p>
            <p>“Luke,” she said softly. “You okay?”</p>
            <p>I didn’t answer. Just looked at my hands. They weren’t shaking. They weren’t clenched. They weren’t small anymore.</p>
