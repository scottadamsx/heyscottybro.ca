        <h1>Chapter 7: Locker Checks</h1>

        <section>
            <p>It started with a shirt. Just a regular T-shirt. Grey. Faded. Nothing on it but a tiny logo near the sleeve.</p>
            <p>It was my rebellion. Small. Silent. Hidden in the bottom of my backpack between my binders and gym clothes. I’d wear it at school and change back into my assigned polo before coming home. Like a soldier slipping off his armor in enemy territory. At school, no one noticed me anymore. And that was the goal. At home, I was still the same quiet boy in the same tucked-in collar. A model son. Respectable. Presentable.</p>
            <p>Until I forgot.</p>
            <p>One day, I came home wearing it. I’d been rushing. Distracted. Laughing with Aiden and Chad about something stupid. A story from class. A joke that only made sense to us. I walked through the door. And froze. He was in the kitchen. Looked up. Saw it. His face didn’t move. But his eyes changed. Sharp. Flat. Calculating.</p>
            <p>“What’s that?”</p>
            <p>I looked down.</p>
            <p>“A shirt.”</p>
            <p>“Not what I gave you.”</p>
            <p>“It’s just for school.”</p>
            <p>“So you’re changing? Hiding things now?”</p>
            <p>He didn’t yell. That was worse. The quiet ones stayed with me.</p>
            <p>That night, he went through my backpack. Then my drawers. Found two more. One from Aiden—black with a bleach stain. One from Chad—an old Mario tee with cracked ink. He held them up like evidence.</p>
            <p>“You think I’m stupid?”</p>
            <p>“No.”</p>
            <p>“Then stop acting like I won’t notice when you lie.”</p>
            <p>After that, the checks became routine. Before school. After school. Bag. Locker. Room.</p>
            <p>I started hiding them in weird places. Inside an old cereal box under my bed. In a rolled-up pair of jeans at the back of the closet.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I’d leave them at school. Stuffed in the corner of my locker. Aiden and Chad caught on. They started bringing extra shirts. “Emergency stash,” Chad said, grinning. “Fashion first aid,” Aiden added. They didn’t understand. Not really. But they tried.</p>
            <p>I remember one day, standing in front of the mirror in the boys’ bathroom, pulling on a shirt that wasn’t technically mine, and thinking—</p>
            <p>This is what freedom feels like.</p>
            <p>It didn’t last.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I gave up. Stopped hiding them. Stopped fighting. Wore the polos. Buttoned up. Tucked in. He didn’t say “thank you.” Just nodded. Like obedience was love. Like surrender was the end goal.</p>
