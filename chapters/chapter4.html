        <h1>Chapter 4: The Book Test</h1>

        <section>
            <p>I had saved for weeks. Dug through couch cushions. Skipped snacks at school. Stashed away birthday money like it was sacred. For one book.</p>
            <p>Heroes of Olympius.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t popular. There was no movie. No hype. Just this dense, mythical, violent epic I stumbled across in a used bookstore one weekend with Mom. I’d held it in my hands like it was alive. Told Dad about it for days. The characters. The premise. The cover art that looked like it had been carved from stone. I wanted it so badly it made my stomach hurt. Then one night, he handed it to me.</p>
            <p>“Heard you talkin’ about this,” he said, tossing it on the kitchen table. Just like that. No bow. No smile. No “I’m proud of you.” But I stared at it like it was glowing.</p>
            <p>It was the first thing he’d ever bought me that felt like he’d been listening. Like he’d seen me. And that mattered. A lot more than I’d like to admit.</p>
            <p>I said thanks. Quiet. Stiff. He just nodded and went back to his phone. I didn’t open it right away. I wanted to wait. For silence. For privacy. For the right moment. This book wasn’t just a book. It was a mirror. A promise. Proof that I could want something, speak it aloud, and maybe—just maybe—receive it without punishment. It sat on my desk like a shrine for three days.</p>
            <p>Then I got grounded.</p>
            <p>I don’t remember what I did. Probably nothing. Maybe I sighed too loud. Or asked a question with too much attitude. Maybe I closed a door with too much force or left the light on in the hallway. That was enough, usually. He came into my room, saw the book still sitting there, unopened.</p>
            <p>“So you want to be an author, huh?” I nodded. “Then here’s what you’re gonna do. You’re grounded, so you’ve got time. Read this. Start to finish. When you’re done, you’re gonna tell me what it was about, how it ended, and what you learned. If you can’t, grounding continues.”</p>
            <p>Just like that, it wasn’t a gift anymore. It was a test.</p>
            <p>My stomach turned.</p>
            <p>The cover that had once looked beautiful now looked like homework. I opened the first page that night. Tried to get into it. I really did. But the words didn’t feel like they used to. I didn’t hear the characters’ voices. I heard his. Pacing behind me. Waiting to quiz me. Looking for a reason to say, “See? You don’t really care about these things. You just say you do.”</p>
            <p>I read three pages.</p>
            <p>Then five.</p>
            <p>Then none. I’d read the same paragraph six times and not remember a word of it. I went to school and sat at the library computer during lunch.</p>
            <p>Typed:</p>
            <p>“Heroes of Olympius summary ending plot main character”</p>
            <p>Clicked the first link. Skimmed it. Printed it. Folded it like a cheat sheet and stuffed it into my pocket. I didn’t feel guilty. I felt sick. Like I had ruined something sacred. Like a priest giving a fake sermon.</p>
            <p>That night, I sat on the edge of my bed while he asked questions. I repeated what I’d read online. Tried to make it sound natural. Tried not to blink too much. He nodded. Crossed his arms. “So you did read it. Good.” Then he left. I exhaled. Not relief—just release. Like letting air out of a balloon you didn’t know you were holding.</p>
            <p>I didn’t touch the book again. It stayed on the shelf. Right next to the novels I was supposed to love. And just like that, I didn’t want to be an author anymore. Not because I didn’t love stories. But because I didn’t want anything he could take away from me.</p>
            <p>He turned my passion into proof. Proof I could follow directions. Be obedient. Take orders disguised as inspiration. He heard me talk about something for weeks. He bought it. And in that moment, he gave me something valuable.</p>
            <p>Not the book. The illusion that love could look like listening. And when he turned that gift into a weapon—when he made me prove that I deserved it—I stopped trusting joy altogether.</p>
            <p>Heroes of Olympius is still on my shelf. Unread. Unloved. A souvenir of something that was supposed to be mine. But in that house, nothing was ever really mine. Not even the things I dreamed about.</p>
