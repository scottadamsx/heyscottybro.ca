        <h1>Chapter 10: A Boy Named Elsewhere</h1>

        <section>
            <p>Elsewhere, I was someone else. Not a son. Not a problem. Not a disappointment walking on eggshells. Just a boy with a name and a backpack. Lifton was small. Quiet. The kind of town where people wave whether they know you or not. I lived in a basement apartment with a mattress on the floor and a kitchen that smelled like rice and damp wood. It was the first place that was mine. Even the mold belonged to me.</p>
            <p>At first, I did nothing. Woke up late. Smoked too much. Ate cereal straight from the box. I walked aimlessly through the town, no destination—just breathing. It felt like cheating. Like I was getting away with something.</p>
            <p>Then I met her. She worked at a used bookstore. Had chipped blue nail polish and eyes that looked like they belonged in a different decade. She asked me what I was reading. I lied and said <em>Heroes of Olympius</em>. She smiled like she didn’t believe me. We stayed up late in parks. Talked about death and cartoons. She made jokes about my muscles, called me “the softest tank” she’d ever met. I didn’t know what to do with someone who didn’t flinch when I spoke. Or when I didn’t.</p>
            <p>I fell in love fast.</p>
            <p>Too fast.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t romance. It was oxygen.</p>
            <p>She made me feel like I could stop holding my breath. So I followed her across the country. Packed my bag and moved without asking. And for a while, it worked.</p>
            <p>Until it didn’t. Until the silence crept back in. Until the old voices came home to roost. Until I started caring more about success than sunsets. Until I looked in the mirror and saw my father’s eyes in my own head.</p>
            <p>I told her I needed to leave. That I needed to become something. That I couldn’t be soft anymore. She nodded. Didn’t cry. Just said, “Don’t forget the version of you that could laugh.” I didn’t answer.</p>
            <p>I packed my things. Bookstore bookmark still in my coat pocket. I took the long way back. Through places I didn’t know. Thinking maybe I’d find myself in the spaces between towns. I didn’t.</p>
            <p>I came home instead.</p>
            <p>Not to rest.</p>
            <p>To conquer. To prove something. To take back the part of me that never got to grow up in peace. But that boy—the one she loved—the one who walked barefoot down side streets and read poems out loud under cloudy skies—</p>
            <p>He stayed in Lifton. He’s still there. A boy named Elsewhere.</p>
