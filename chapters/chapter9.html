        <h1>Chapter 8.5: At Isaac’s</h1>

        <section>
            <p>“Where’s Sophie?” That was the question I used to ask. At first, Mom would say, “At Isaac’s,” like it was a placeholder. Like she was just out for a bit. Like she'd be back. Eventually, she stopped saying it. She didn’t need to. Because we already knew. Sophie was at Isaac’s. That’s where she lived now, unofficially. That’s where she was safe.</p>
            <p>It didn’t happen all at once. First, she started going there on weekends. Then a few nights a week. Then we stopped setting a place for her at the dinner table. Then we stopped expecting her at all. Dad pretended not to care.</p>
            <p>Said things like:</p>
            <p>“She’ll come back when she needs something.”<br>
               “He’s not gonna keep putting up with her.”<br>
               “It’s just teenage rebellion. Let her wear herself out.”</p>
            <p>But I think he knew. Sophie had found an escape route. And she’d taken it without hesitation.</p>
            <p>I used to get mad. Not at her—just at what it meant. Her absence filled the house louder than her presence ever did. I’d see her empty seat at the table and feel like a ghost had moved in.</p>
            <p>Mom would say, “She’s doing what she needs to do right now.” Abbey would smirk and say, “She’s finally smart enough to run.” And me? I’d just sit with the lamb in my lap and stare at the floor. Because the house was quieter. But not safer.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I’d see Isaac drop her off to grab something. He never came to the door. He’d sit in his car, engine running, nodding at me through the windshield. Once, I walked past and waved. He nodded again. Calm. Respectful. Like he knew I wasn’t ready to be him yet.</p>
            <p>Sophie would sweep in, grab her charger or a bag of clothes, and disappear again. No fights. No tension. Just absence.</p>
            <p>One night, I heard her laugh through the phone. She was upstairs packing a bag. It sounded full. Light. Unrecognizable. She hadn’t laughed like that here in years. That’s when I understood. She wasn’t “at Isaac’s.” She was gone. But she wasn’t lost.</p>
            <p>The lamb was on the floor again that night. I didn’t throw it. I didn’t touch it. I just looked at it and whispered:<br>
            “You should’ve left too.”</p>

        <h1 style="margin-top: 60px;">Chapter 9: The Guest Room That Wasn’t Mine</h1>

        <section>
            <p>I was twenty when I came home. Not because I missed it. Not because I wanted to. Because something in me was still missing, and this was the last place I hadn’t looked.</p>
            <p>I’d left years earlier.</p>
            <p>Tried school, but COVID hit like a freight train. Zoom classes, deadlines I couldn’t track, depression that spread through me like mold in the walls. I dropped out without a word. Packed a bag, moved west.</p>
            <p>Lifton, BC.</p>
            <p>Found quiet. Found air. Fell in love with a girl who laughed like spring and touched me like I was something soft. Followed her across provinces, across moods, across the country. And then I left her too. Not because she was wrong. Because I still wasn’t right. Because success was calling louder than love. Because fulfillment felt like the only thing that might silence the noise.</p>
            <p>And fulfillment, I thought, might live back here. In the house I left behind.</p>
            <p>Mom met me at the door. Hugged me like someone checking for cracks. Dad didn’t hug. Just nodded.</p>
            <p>“So. You’re back.”<br>
            “Just for a while.”<br>
            “We’ll see.”</p>
            <p>My old room wasn’t mine anymore. It was a guest room now. Neutral tones. Folded towels on the dresser. Air freshener that smelled like someone else’s idea of home. My posters were gone. My shelves were empty. All that remained of me was the dust that hadn’t been wiped clean.</p>
            <p>In the closet, under a box of linens, I found the lamb. It was still there. But it wasn’t the same. Matted fur. One eye gone. Stuffing creeping through a seam in its neck. I held it for a second. Then put it on the shelf. It looked smaller now. Or maybe I was just bigger.</p>
            <p>Abbey passed by the door that night. Took one look at me sitting on the bed with the lamb staring down from its perch and said: “Welcome back to the zoo.” Then she disappeared into a haze of weed smoke and irony. I lay down on the bed. The mattress was firmer than I remembered. Less forgiving. Like everything else in this house.</p>
            <p>The next morning, I came downstairs. Dad was already at the table, reading. Mom was cooking in silence. No one said good morning. Abbey was at the counter making coffee. Smiled like a wolf. “Big muscles. New beard. Same hollow eyes.” I smirked. “Good to see you too.”</p>
            <p>Sophie wasn’t home. “She’s at Isaac’s,” Mom said. Of course she was. Still safe. Still smart.</p>
            <p>I sat at the table, not sure if I was a son or a guest. Dad looked at me once. Didn’t say anything. Just turned the page in his paper like it was the most important thing in the room.</p>
            <p>After breakfast, I went upstairs and stood in front of the mirror. Flexed. Reflexively. My arms were solid. My chest wide. My face sharper. I looked like protection.</p>
            <p>But my eyes were still his. Still afraid. Still waiting. I saw the lamb on the shelf in the mirror’s reflection. And for a moment, I didn’t see a man. I saw a boy in a costume. A survivor in disguise.</p>
            <p>I sat on the edge of the bed. The towels on the dresser stared at me like folded witnesses. I lay back and closed my eyes. The bed creaked under my weight. Not like it used to. I wasn’t small anymore. And this house had no room for who I’d become.</p>
