        <h1>Chapter 2: Mushrooms</h1>

        <section>
            <p>It started because I didn’t want to eat them.</p>
            <p>That was all.</p>
            <p>It was chili night—something Mom made often because it was cheap, easy, and enough to feed five. She’d put mushrooms in by accident. She forgot I hated them. I’d always hated them. Their texture, the way they collapsed when you chewed, like spoiled balloons. The taste didn’t bother me—it was the idea. They were soft. Malleable. Weak.</p>
            <p>I didn’t say anything at first. I just started picking them out. Silently. Casually. The way you pick lint off a sleeve.</p>
            <p>Dad was already on edge. I don’t remember why. Sometimes it was traffic. Sometimes it was work. Sometimes it was nothing. He sat across from me at the table, eating quickly, like the food had wronged him.</p>
            <p>He looked up once. Saw the pile of mushrooms on my napkin. Said nothing. Then he stood up. Walked into the kitchen.</p>
            <p>I heard the fridge open. Then the chopping board. Then the knife. He was muttering to himself. I caught pieces: “Ungrateful… doesn’t know what he has… wasting food…” The oil hissed as it hit the pan. He sautéed the entire pack. No seasoning. No onions. Just mushrooms—wet, browning, breaking down. He returned to the table with a bowl. Piled high. He placed it in front of me like a trophy. Or a punishment. Maybe both. “This is your supper,” he said. “Let’s see how picky you are now.”</p>
            <p>Mom said nothing. My sisters looked away. I looked down at the bowl. It steamed like shame. I tried. I really did.</p>
            <p>I chewed the first bite and swallowed like it was glass. The second took longer. By the third, my stomach was starting to turn.</p>
            <p>Dad didn’t eat. He just watched. I made it through maybe five or six before I stopped. I asked if I could be excused. “You leave that table, you don’t eat tomorrow,” he said.</p>
            <p>So I stayed.</p>
            <p>For hours. Everyone else moved on—homework, dishes, TV.</p>
            <p>I sat there, alone. The mushrooms grew cold and slick. The smell coated my throat. At some point, the lamb was in my lap. I don’t remember when I brought it down. Or why. I held it under the table like a secret.</p>
            <p>Around 10 p.m., Mom came in. Whispered, “Just go to bed. I’ll deal with it.”</p>
            <p>I stood up slowly, legs numb, eyes burning. Dad didn’t look up from the couch. That night, I held the lamb tighter than I had in years. I wasn’t crying. But I wasn’t breathing, either. I pressed it against my face and whispered into its matted ear: “Next time, I’ll just eat the fucking mushrooms.”</p>
